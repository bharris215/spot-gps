## v0.1.0, Unreleased

- Wrap responses in SPOT::Resources::Message objects, making them easier to work
  with (allows date/time parsing, etc.).
- Drop support for all Ruby versions prior to 2.3 (would be easy to
  re-introduce, but I imagine anyone using this gem is building a new app).
- Rename Spot::API to Spot::Client

## v0.0.1, 10 July 2016

- Initial release
